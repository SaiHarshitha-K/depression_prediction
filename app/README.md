# üß† Suicide Detection Web App (Flask + XGBoost)

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to input a message and receive a prediction on whether the text is **likely suicidal** or **likely non-suicidal**. It uses a pre-trained XGBoost model (`xgb_pipeline.pkl`) for classification.
